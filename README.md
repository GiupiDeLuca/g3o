# IoTeX Geo Location Package

This package allows to seamlessly interact with the IoTeX API for trusted geo location. 

This project contains 2 packages, `generate-siwe` and `geolocation`

The `generate-siwe` package is used to create a siwe message that will have to be signed by the user. Then, using the `geolocation` package, the application will be able to query the API to get a proof of the user's presence in a certain location area, within a time range.
